# TidyProject

A light package providing:
 
* Directory structure: a light, tidy project template for data analysis projects.
* Project library: Like packrat, defines a project library, but allows access to global library.  Removes user library to aids in code portability and reproducibility in environments where the global library is fixed.
* Version control: compatibity with git (git2r).
